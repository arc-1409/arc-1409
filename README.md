Hello, weary traveler. 

I'm a cybersecurity undergrad at Purdue University with a wide range of interests and a passion in learning about anything and everything. My projects and endless lists of ideas are not necessarily centered around cybersecurity but always deeply personal, as to me, coding isn't just a tool but a definite pathway to personal fulfillment and self-actualization. Coding is an art that I study and admire, and I aspire to one day do great things with it.
